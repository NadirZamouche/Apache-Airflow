1. What is it? BashOperator is an Airflow operator that lets you run shell (bash) commands as a task inside a DAG. Use it when you want to:
   - run Linux commands (echo, cp, rm, curl, psql, etc.)
   - call scripts (.sh)
   - glue tools together without Python logic

2. Library: from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator

3. Operator function (important args)
BashOperator(
    task_id="task_name",
    bash_command="your bash command here",
)

4. Example:
task1 = BashOperator(task_id="first_task", bash_command="echo Task Force 1")
